    <h2>Everything has to face critisicm</h2>
    <p>
      Khan Academy has been criticized because Salman Khan does not have a background in pedagogy. Statements made in some videos have been questioned. In response to these criticisms, the organization has fixed errors in its videos, expanded its faculty and built a network of content specialists. Others have presented data showing Khan videos are less effective than those of other publishers and that the concept of chalk on a blackboard is less engaging for students than other styles of video, such as cartoons.<br>

In an interview from January 2016, Khan defended the value of Khan Academy online lectures while acknowledging their limitations: "I think they're valuable, but I'd never say they somehow constitute a complete education." Khan Academy positions itself as a supplement to in-class learning, a modern education tool which aims to humanize the classroom using technology
