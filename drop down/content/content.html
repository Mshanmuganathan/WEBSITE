     Khan Academy's website aims to provide a personalized learning experience, mainly built on the videos which are hosted on YouTube. The website is meant to be used as a supplement to its videos, because it includes other features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. The material can also be accessed through mobile applications.<br>

The videos show a recording of drawings on an electronic blackboard, which are similar to the style of a teacher giving a lecture. The narrator describes each drawing and how they relate to the material being taught. Nonprofit groups have distributed offline versions of the videos to rural areas in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Videos range from all subjects covered in school and for all grades, Kindergarten to High School.<br>

Khan Academy videos have been translated into many of the world's most popular languages, with many videos dubbed into the world's top spoken languages. There are close to 20,000 subtitle translations available. Khan Academy offers its platform in 5 languages: English (en), Spanish (es), Portuguese (pt), French (fr) and Bengali (bn).<br>

It also provides online courses for preparing for standardized tests, including the SAT and MCAT.
