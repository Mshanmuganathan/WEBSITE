     Bennet:<br>
      I started practising with Khan Academy in July ahead of my SAT test on October 7th. It was my first time and Khan Academy was my only practice tool.<br>

      When I tried my first full length practice test, I had 1040 with 520 for both sections. I increased my practice schedule and made sure I studied every day until the test day. After the result was released, I scored 1310 with 690 at the maths section and 620 at evidence based reading and writing section. Thus, I had a 270 point increment just practising 3 months with Khan Academy. I hope to improve it more. Khan Academy is the best and I recommend it to everyone<br>

	 I have been out of school for about ten years. I wanted to go back to school, but was worried I would not remember much and do poorly on my entrance exam and be stuck taking many classes and wasting time on things I should have remembered. My friend told me about Khan Academy and thought it would help me. Over the summer, I studied math everyday on Khan Academy. When it came time to take my entrance exam, I excelled. I tested out of all my pre-requisites and was able to get right into the program I had as my goal. I am taking paramedic courses and I am currently still using Khan Academy for my classes. I just wanted to share this because Sal Khan is a genius! I can not thank him enough for this wonderful tool. I would not be on the road I am on without his help. I wanted to just post my gratitude and I hope many others discover Khan Academy and take advantage of what it has to offer. Khan academy has helped me change my life and I hope it does for other. Thank you Sal!<br>

	 Not quite 1 year ago, I watched a video about a young man who used Khan Academy to learn math from Algebra to Calculus. I didn't believe it. I struggled with math in school, but I never stopped being curious about it. So I gave Khan Academy a try. And then I got hooked. I managed to master Pre-Algebra through Differential Calculus in about a year.

It really is possible. And it's worth it. I can only describe it as learning to readâ€“I can literally read and understand books and ideas that I couldn't just one year ago. Thank you, Khan Academy.<br>
	Katharina Haller:
	Last week I got an email saying that I was offered a spot to study medicine at Medical University Vienna! I have been studying for the entrance test for nearly a year now and this day a dream of mine came true - THANKS TO YOU GUYS!<br>

Without the many many videos about physics, maths, chemistry and biology I could never have done it!! And, to be honest, I cannot wait for my studies to commence just to find myself again being inspired by you!!<br>

There is no such website as yours where studying is so much fun and keeps one going - i am still finding myself in the evenings watching some videos of Sal just because they are SO SO GOOD!!!<br>

Keep on going like this - you guys are great and I admire you for your passion and education every day - THANK YOU x 1000!!!<br>
