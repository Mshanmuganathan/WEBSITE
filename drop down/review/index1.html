    <h2>The truth</h2>
    <p>
      Khan Academy is freeâ€”not to be confused with freemium or ad-supported. To use Khan Academy, you don't even need an account. As a website, Khan Academy is available anywhere there is an Internet connection, which includes about forty percent of the world's population, and, thanks to a grant from Google's Project 10^100, much content has been translated for anyone who uses a widely-spoken language. (Khan Academy even offers French, Portuguese, and Spanish versions of its site). Evaluating whether it provides a world-class education is more challenging. Although the site is available worldwide, I am not yet persuaded that an education founded on YouTube micro-lectures and machine-graded assessments is "among the best in the world."

    <h2>GOOD!</h2>
    <p>
      Despite both its longevity and popularity, Khan Academy remains difficult to classify. The site is built around short video lectures (usually ten minutes or less), machine-graded assessments, and comments threads. However, to call these tutorials "online courses" is misleading. Comments are attached to lectures, and while users can flag, up-vote, and down-vote responses, threads bear little comparison to the faculty- or TA-moderated discussions on edX and Coursera. Unlike an online course offered at a traditional school, lectures have no prerequisites (in fact, that's part of their appeal) and they do not offer course credit. By the same token, Khan Academy is not really a MOOC (massive open online course). Although Khan Academy invites unlimited Web participation, tutorials are self-paced, without start or end dates. Assessments are not fixed, either; rather, users dip into a huge repository of computer-graded problem questions and exercises.

Exploring Khan Academy is as simple as following your nose. You do not need an account to search the site's catalog of skills, subjects, and videos. In fact, you do not even need to use the site to watch its tutorials, available on YouTube. That said, there are advantages to having an account: You can set your default language (English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese), track your progress, and participate in gamified features. It's also easy. You can sign up with your email address or sign in with a Facebook or Google+ account. You can engage Khan Academy as a teacher, parent, or student (most common).

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
     With a growing repository of free tutorials and exercises, Khan Academy enables tech-savvy learners, particularly U.S. K-12 students interested in STEM fields, to supplement existing knowledge and to explore new topics.
